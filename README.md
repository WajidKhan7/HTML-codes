# HTML-codes
HyperText Markup Language is the standard language used to create and structure content on web pages. It uses tags (like &lt;html>, &lt;head>, &lt;body>, &lt;p>, &lt;img>, etc.) to define elements such as text, images, links, tables, and forms. HTML provides the basic framework of a website, which is then styled using CSS and made interactive with JavaScript.
